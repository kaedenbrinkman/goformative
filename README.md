# GoFormative web app
A simple and very limited web interface that fetches questions and answers from GoFormative.


To use it, you need your user ID, the ID of the formative, and your bearer token.


Test it out: https://kaedenbrinkman.github.io/goformative


Note: The answers available on the API are only answers that you have already entered. The correct answers are not available.
